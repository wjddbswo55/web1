  Jiho: Hi, Lisa. What are you looking at on the Internet?
  Lisa:  I'm checking out a young inventor's blog. He regularly posts about his inventions and discoveries. They are interesting.
Jiho: Wow, it souinds fun! Did you find anything special?
Lisa:  Yes. One of the items he's developing is an outdoor drink holder.
  Jiho: What's that? Tell me about it.  Lisa:  It is a holder that can be folded. He is not satisfied with normal cup holders.
  It's hard to carry them around, so he's making his own holder.
  Jiho: Oh, he is really creative. I want to learn more about his inventions.
